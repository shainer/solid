Project for Google Summer of Code 2012: high-level partitioning library built on top of Solid.

The fork of the master branch has been created in 2016; the partitioner branch contains the
implementation. It was branched off in 2012 and never merged; it is here for my personal
amusement only, and to provide the basis for the plugin which is hosted in its own repository.

The bulk of the code is contained in solid/solid/partitioner.
